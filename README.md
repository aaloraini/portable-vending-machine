## üöÄ Quick Start (Firmware)

To get the firmware running on your hardware:

1.  **Open** the `Machine_Logic.ino` file in the **Arduino IDE (2.x recommended)**.
2.  **Select Board:** Choose *Arduino Mega 2560* (or modify the code for your specific board).
3.  **Install Libraries** (via Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries):
    - `LiquidCrystal_I2C` by Frank de Brabander (for the 16√ó2 LCD).
    - `Keypad` by Mark Stanley, Alexander Brevig (for the 4√ó4 matrix keypad).
    - The built-in `Stepper` library is used for motor control.
4.  **Wire the modules** according to the schematic (`Electronics Sch.png`). Key connections:
    - LCD via I2C (SDA, SCL)
    - Keypad rows and columns
    - Coin selector signal pin
    - ULN2003 stepper driver boards
    - 12V‚Üí5V buck converter for power
5.  **Compile** and **Upload** the sketch to your board.
6.  **Test:** Open the Serial Monitor (if debugging is enabled), insert a coin (or simulate a pulse), select a product, and observe the vending sequence.

The complete parts list is available in: `Demo BOM.xlsx`

**Key Components:**
-   Arduino Mega 2560
-   16√ó2 LCD with I2C backpack
-   4√ó4 Matrix Keypad
-   Coin Selector (12V with pulse output)
-   Buck Converter (12V to 5V)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Logic

The operational workflow is detailed in: `machine-logic.pdf`

**Nominal State Flow:**
1.  **Idle:** Waits for a coin pulse.
2.  **Balance Update:** Credit is added and displayed on the LCD.
3.  **Selection:** User inputs a product code via the keypad.
4.  **Vend:** If credit is sufficient, the cost is deducted, and the corresponding stepper motor is activated.
5.  **Thank You:** A confirmation message is displayed before returning to the **Idle** state.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Reproduce

Follow these steps to build your own unit:

1.  **Mechanical Assembly:**
    -   Review the `Vending Machine Layouts.pdf` for dimensions and assembly instructions.
    -   Fabricate parts using a laser cutter or 3D printer as indicated.
2.  **Electronics Assembly:**
    -   Wire all components according to the `Electronics Sch.png` schematic.
    -   Use the `Demo BOM.xlsx` to source all necessary parts.
    -   **Power Note:** The system uses a 12V supply. A buck converter steps this down to 5V for the MCU and logic, while the coin selector runs directly on 12V (its signal is conditioned for the MCU).
3.  **Software Setup:**
    -   Upload the `Machine_Logic.ino` sketch to your Arduino.
    -   Calibrate the code for your specific hardware: adjust pin definitions, motor step counts, and pulses-per-coin value.
4.  **Testing & Calibration:**
    -   Test coin insertion and verify the credit updates correctly.
    -   Test each product channel to ensure the correct motor runs for the intended duration.
